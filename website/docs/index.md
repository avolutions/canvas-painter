# Introduction

**CanvasPainter.js** is a simple yet powerful JavaScript library for drawing basic shapes (rectangles, circles, etc.) on HTML5 Canvas with ease. Perfect for creating 2D graphics in your web projects.

The core idea behind **CanvasPainter.js** is to provide a simple way to work with shapes that are automatically rendered to the canvas. The package includes built-in shapes, such as rectangles and circles, that you can easily create and render. If a shape's properties (like position or size) change, the canvas is automatically updated without needing to manually call any `context.draw` methods. You can also create your own custom shapes or extending the default shapes functionality.

This approach simplifies drawing and keeps your code clean, but if you want full control or need advanced features, you can still access the standard Canvas 2D Context API through `Canvas.context` and use all of its methods directly.
