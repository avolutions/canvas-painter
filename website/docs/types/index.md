# Types

In **CanvasPainter.js**, types play a crucial role in defining the data structures that help manage the shapes, positions, and styles used on the canvas. These types are essentially objects that encapsulate data and provide utility methods to interact with that data more efficiently.

Working with well-defined types ensures that your code is easier to maintain, and it also helps prevent errors by enforcing the structure of the data. Types allow for more intuitive manipulation of elements on the canvas, enabling transformations, style management, and accurate positioning with minimal effort.

Throughout this chapter, you'll discover how these types provide a foundation for working with canvas elements in a clear and predictable way. By using these types, you'll not only simplify your workflow but also unlock the full potential of **CanvasPainter.js** when creating dynamic, interactive graphics.
